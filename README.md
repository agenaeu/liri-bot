# liri-bot
In this app you start by going to the terminal. 
From here you will type in node liri.js. 
After liri.js you will type one of four actions, concert-this, spotify-this-song, movie-this, or do-what-it-says.
Lastly you will add either the band name, song name, or movie name.
For do-what-it-says you dont have to follow with anything.
Examples would be 
* node liri.js spotify-this-song faithfully
* ![Alt text](https://github.com/agenaeu/liri-bot/blob/master/images/spotify-this-song.png)
* node liri.js concert-this smashing pumpkins
